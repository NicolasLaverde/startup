Pseudoclass:

Link related pseudoClass:

A pseudoclass in css3 define a special state of an element, for example
when we want to change the color of a link, we use the selector of the 
tag <a> and 4 pseudoclasses basic to change its color in 4 different 
states, these are:

   :link{ define the rules that happen when the link is unvissited}
   :visited{ define the rules that happen when link is visited}
   :hover {define the rules that happen when the pointer is over the link}
   :active{ define the rules that happen when the link is active, or
      the rules happen just after user clicks it}

"Perhaps the most confusion-causing link-related pseudo selector. 
Aren't all <a> links? Well not if they don't have an href attribute. 
This selects only those that do"
